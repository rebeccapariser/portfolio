              <h4>Friday on the Farm</h4>
              <p>There&rsquo;s never a dull minute here on the farm. Between our new barn, and exciting new interactive exhibit in the learning garden, and the always entertaining antics of the critters it has been a busy week.</p>
              <p>The new barn is looking fabulous. The crew was working on the cupola yesterday. I wonder what kind of weathervane it will have.</p>
              <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
              <p>The new structure in our Learning Garden is taking shape.</p>
              <p>The goal of this new exhibit is to help visitors get excited and about food and where it comes from. Kids will be able to &ldquo;harvest&rdquo; a three-foot beet, climb through an underground tunnel, drive the tractor to market, and follow a tomato from farm to fork.  It&rsquo;s late in the season so the giant veggies that it will display may only make a brief appearance this season before they head to the root cellar, but come visit when it&rsquo;s open and look for the giant earthworm!</p>
              <br/>
              <p>There&rsquo;s a beautiful trellis on the side of the structure. Look for it to be in full bloom next summer.</p>
              <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
              <p>Out in the pasture the cows were enjoying the sun. Looks like someone&rsquo;s the odd man out.</p>
              <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
              <p>And right next door, the piglets. They never seem to all sleep facing one direction. It&rsquo;s always some sort of odd arrangement like here, a group of one, a group of two, and then a group of three&mdash;all smushed together  for optimum comfort!</p>
              <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
              <p>Today it sure feels like winter, but even when we think it&rsquo;s dark and cold I found something growing, a little grass growing right out of a straw bale left in a sunny spot.</p>
              <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
              <p>And a final parting thought. Not many visitors venture out to the fields this time of year, but it&rsquo;s really beautiful, a wide open space to see the sky.</p>
              <p>There&rsquo;s also something about the dormancy of the fields that&rsquo;s amazing&mdash;so much potential, and so peaceful.</p>              <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

                <br/>
                <p>Slow down and enjoy the holiday!</p>

				<p>It was a quiet and rainy day on the farm yesterday… until  I got the e-mail from our farmer Caroline that the new piglets had arrived at the farm. They&rsquo;re still getting used to their new surroundings and their reaction to  visitors seems to be a lot of squealing and bunching up in the corner in a true pig pile!</p>
                <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
                <p>Meanwhile, at the bottom of our entrance hill the construction continues. The barn is looking really nice, and yesterday we had a new &ldquo;mini-barn&rdquo; delivered that sits beside the new big barn. The &ldquo;mini-barn&rdquo; will be a veggie wash station for our crops crew and a pickup area for our summer CSA.</p>
                <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
				<p>And I wasn&rsquo;t the only one enjoying the goings on at the construction site. Can you see my feathered friend keeping a close look out?</p>
                <br/><br/>
                <p>For those of you curious about the new fisher, it is out on display, but we&rsquo;ve roped off the area to let him/her get used to being in the new enclosure. Very soon everyone will be able to see it.</p>
				<p>In other news on the farm our winter CSA distributions have begun. I know the root veggies can get old come March, but for now salads with late fall greens, crispy Kohlrabi and beautiful watermelon radish are a special treat!</p>
                <p>Tomorrow&rsquo;s going to be beautiful, why not join us for a <a href="http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/Sanctuaries/Drumlin_Farm/listing.php?program_code=1293-DFP11FA2" target="_blank">Naturalist Walk</a>?</p>

                <h4>How Do I Cook This?</h4>
				<p>One of the most common questions at the Drumlin Farm admissions window during the months we have our farmstand open is, &ldquo;How do I cook this?&rdquo; Since November is a time when many people spend a lot of time in the kitchen, we&rsquo;re offering some of our staff&rsquo;s favorite ideas. If you join us at our February Winter Harvest Dinner, you can continue the discussion over a freshly prepared Drumlin Farm dinner.</p>
                <p>The ideas are simple, and leave plenty of room for creativity. Root vegetables are fantastic roasted with salt, pepper, olive oil, and your choice of fresh (or dried) herbs. Drumlin Farm staff members are also a fan of the root mash (boil or roast the veggies before mashing) which can include any combination of potato, turnips, parsnips, kohlrabi, celeriac, parsnips, rutabaga, and carrots. Try it with butter, chicken or vegetable stock, or if you&rsquo;re going for sweetness, try maple syrup, brown sugar and a bit of ginger.</p>
                <p>Here&rsquo;s a family recipe from our preschool director Paula:</p>
                <br/>
                <p><u>Nana&rsquo;s Candied Sweet Potatoes</u></p>
                <ul>
                <li>6 sweet potatoes boiled in skins</li>
                <li>1 stick butter</li>
                <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
                <li>1 cup maple syrup</li>
                </ul>
				<p>Cool slightly, peel, and cut into halves or quarters</p>
                <p>In large, deep-sided frying pan melt butter and add walnuts and maple syrup. Heat almost to boiling, stirring constantly. Add sweet potatoes, turning gently in low boil for 15 minutes. Transfer to casserole and keep warm until dinner.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Visitors also frequently ask us what to do with the variety of greens we offer at the farmstand. Many of our greens are great raw, even greens that at first glance seem tough. Kale, cut up finely, works well in a salad with a vinegar-based dressing. (Kale also makes delicious chips. Recipes are all over for these quick easy snacks.) The collard greens require a bit longer cooking time, but can be simply boiled and tossed with vinegar as a quick side dish. Cabbage can be used raw or cooked.</p>
                <p>From our camp director Becky, a quick tasty raw salad:</p>
                <br/>
                <ul>
                <li>Cabbage—any color, shredded</li>
                <li>1 head cilantro leaves, chopped</li>
                <li>Juice of 2 limes</li>
                <li>Sea salt</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Combine all together and serve. Adjust lime juice to own liking.</p>
                <br/>

           		<h4>11/4</h4>
           		<p>Our brand new Crossroads Barn is coming along nicely. The crew working on it are making a lot of progress each day. Just look at these two photos that were taken only two days apart.</p>
				<p>The new space is going to be great! We&rsquo;ll keep sharing updates.</p>
                <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
				<p>After a rather unpleasant start to the week with mostly everyone without power Friday was a beautiful blue sky day. What foliage there is left really shined against the deep blue.</p>
                <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
                <p>Does this squash kind of look like it was once round but was deflated, or perhaps melted? Really it&rsquo;s just the shape it grew in, but it gave me a chuckle.</p>
                <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
                <p>And last but not least on this brief Friday round-up, thanks to everyone who joined us last week for Tales of the Night. It was a brisk evening weather wise, but we had a blast! The farm was bustling and folks really seemed to be enjoying the event (and the wonderful carved pumpkins).</p>
                <p>Thanks again to all of the volunteers (we had a ton&mdash;and from a number of different organizations) who helped the day of the event, and in the week leading up to it carving the pumpkins.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Looks like the Intel volunteers got creative carving those pumpkins!</p>
                <p>Thanks again&mdash;we hope to see everyone again next year!</p>
