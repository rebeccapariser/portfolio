    	<h4>Camp Goals</h4>
		<p>We aim to create an experience that is both educational and fun, and uses the diverse habitats that our sanctuary has to offer. Campers will do farm chores, and learn about agriculture and livestock. They will also learn about various natural habitats, mainly the fields, forests, and ponds and wetlands that dot the sanctuary, doing activities such as ponding, bug catching, bird watching, and log rolling to learn about the various inhabitants of each ecosystem. Our Teacher/Naturalists are all individuals that are excited and enthusiastic about nature and agriculture and are looking to pass that joy on to the younger generation. We feel that we provide a unique camp environment that you cannot find anywhere else.</p>
		<h4>Our Program</h4>
		<p>Many of the problems facing today&rsquo;s society center around the mistreatment of the world&rsquo;s natural ecosystems. We believe that the best way to combat the wrongs that are being committed is to educate the next generation of the value of the environment, not just areas that are wild but also through responsible agricultural practices. Our camp program balances education and fun, tailoring activities and educational experiences based on the age of each camp group.</p>
        <p>Summer at Drumlin Farm is a special time and Drumlin Farm has been offering summer camp programs to children since 1956. The sanctuary fills with the joyous shouts and songs of children, all exploring the diverse habitats that we have to offer. They will do chores on the farm, mucking stalls, weeding, feeding animals, and even milking a cow. They will also adventure into nature, exploring the forest, ponds, and fields looking to discover life. We aim to teach campers about the connectedness of the natural world, and emphasize our place within it as respectful citizens and stewards of the planet.</p>
        <p>Older campers will expand their knowledge through programs that focus on specialized knowledge in areas such as conservation, sustainable agriculture, local cultural history, and the habitats of Massachusetts. Like any other summer camp, the day is also filled with songs, stories, games, cooking, campfires, and most of all, fun. Each session there is an all-camp family night that gives parents the chance to meet the staff and experience the joy of camp first hand.</p>
        <p>Make your summer a Drumlin summer!</p>
