    <h4>Community Preschool</h4>
    <p>Drumlin Farm&rsquo;s Community Preschool is open and enrolling children ages 3 to 6 years old.</p>
    <p>The Community Preschool program was founded on the idea that play&mdash;both indoor and outdoor, structured and unstructured&mdash;is an important facilitator for children&rsquo;s learning. It allows children to safely explore, learn and experiment in the outdoors, all the while developing an awareness and appreciation for themselves, each other and the environment.</p>
    <p>The curriculum is based on interests of the children, as well as seasonal happenings on the farm and sanctuary. We offer many opportunities for learning, exploring. Each day is filled with hands-on experiences for students.</p>
    <p>Our Preschool program is licensed by the Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care and recognized for quality early education experiences for young children. We are open for 37 weeks each year, from week of Sept. 8, 2009 to the week of June 14, 2010. Applications will be accepted on a first come, first serve basis and enrollment or waitlist letters will be sent to prospective families shortly thereafter. Enrollment is ongoing and based on the spaces that may be available within the program.</p>
