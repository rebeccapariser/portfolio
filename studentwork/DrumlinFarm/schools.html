    <h4>Environmental Education Programs for Grades Pre K &ndash; 8</h4>
    <p>At Drumlin Farm Wildlife Sanctuary our programs cultivate an appreciation and understanding of native plants, animals, and their habitats so we can all work together to ensure that they are protected. By creating educational experiences that develop a learner's awareness and understanding of his or her interrelationship with the natural world, we strive to generate a more conservation-minded citizenry. Drumlin Farm is one of Mass Audubon's statewide network of sanctuaries&mdash;unique in its position as both a working farm and wildlife sanctuary.</p>
    <p>Since it was bequeathed to Mass Audubon almost fifty years ago, Drumlin Farm has delivered environmental education programs to hundreds of thousands of elementary, middle, and high school students in Massachusetts.Today, students and teachers can still experience a curriculum that focuses on the study of Massachusetts' habitats.These natural communities help us learn about our interconnection with the land, as well as the natural and cultural history of our state and the need for conservation.</p>
	<h4>On-Site Programs</h4>
    <p>On-Site School programs take full advantage of the opportunities to learn about the ecology of diverse habitats and the adaptations of the animals and plants that live there.</p>
    <h4>Ark Outreach Programs</h4>
    <p>Our Ark Outreach program brings our naturalists and native wildlife to schoolyards and neighborhoods throughout the state.</p>
    <h4>Both On-Site and Ark Outreach Programs</h4>
    <p>Both programs enrich and extend natural history and science lessons in your classroom and help build connections with your local environment. A combination of the two programs, On-Site at Drumlin and Ark Outreach at your school, can create a more comprehensive understanding of our interrelationship with the land that sustains and surrounds us.</p>
    <p>We are committed to making your Drumlin experience, whether at the Sanctuary or at your school, one that honors our time-tested methods while meeting the curricular needs of today.</p>

	<h4>Boy Scout and Girl Scout Programs</h4>
    <p>Drumlin Farm Wildlife Sanctuary offers on- and off-site programs specifically designed to meet the needs and interests of scouts. Taking part in one of our programs allows scouts to gain an appreciation and awareness of the natural world while learning responsibility toward themselves, their peers, and their community. Several of our programs are designed to meet badge requirements, and we also offer customized programming. For more information contact our education staff.</p>
